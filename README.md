# Task for survio

- create a new project using npx create-react-app survio
- delete the default components
- add two input fields with number type and one button (labeled
GENERATE) to the root component
- on each click of the button generate a new two-dimensional array
with random values 1 or 2 and store it in the root component state
- the value from the first input is the number of columns and
the value from the second input is the number of rows
example inputs with values 2 and 3 can generate an array like this:
[[2, 1], [1, 1], [1, 2]]
example inputs with values 3 and 4 can generate an array like this:
[[2, 1, 2], [2, 1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [2, 2, 1]]
- create a Table component (without using third-party libraries) that will retrieve data from the root state through props
- each cell in the table with a value of 1 will be red and each cell in the table with a value of 2 will be green
- add two more buttons to the root component (labeled ASC and DESC) which sort the rows on click by the sum of their values
- add another button to the root component (labeled FILTER) which filters the rows on click by their sum of values which is lower than average
- focus on performance (redrawing individual cells)
- no need to create css styles (this is just about application logic)
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
